# Web-Scraper
A web scraper that extracts data from a Steam page, such as the name, price, and current date, every 24 hours and records it in a CSV file. It also triggers a sound notification if the game is on sale.

[Elden Ring's Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/) is the example used in the code.
